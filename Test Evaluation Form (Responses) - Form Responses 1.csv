The data model may need some fine tuning as the sentiment colors in this model seem a little different than what I would expect based on what I read in the news. But the concept is definitely worth investing more efforts into it. Good Luck!!

Were tweets that included racist terms like kung flu/wuhan/china virus included? Is misinformation included/assessed? Sarcasm?

Change the color scheme to orange/blue to account for colorblind users. Additionally, you might want to include tweet counts and additional geotagged data within the dashboard for additional insights."

First, I'm confused by what ""positive"" and ""negative"" means, since it's not clearly explained on the website. For example, does ""positive sentiment"" on masks mean that the tweet advocated wearing masks, whereas ""negative sentiment"" expressed doubt about masks being effective? It would help to show some example tweets from each category. If this is the right interpretation, then the data doesn't make intuitive sense to me. The overall sentiment doesn't really change much between March and October, and different countries seem to have wildly different and surprising sentiments. I guess this is due to small sample sizes, but the website doesn't display the exact sample sizes in the ""aggregated"" view, only relative sizes of circles without a scale, so it's hard to interpret. What is the uncertainty, or error, in the analysis? Also, what kind of tweets fall into the ""Other"" category? I didn't see an explanation of this anywhere. Another concern is that the data isn't granular enough. I don't think that aggregating tweet sentiment across an entire country is particularly useful for decision-makers operating at local geographic scales. In any case, I think the best way to make the website easier to understand would be to add more labels and legends, and a paragraph at the top describing what data the map is showing."

There are 3 splotches in Canada that are consistently a lighter shade than the rest of the country. There is a lighter shade splotch in Russia just north of Mongolia.
